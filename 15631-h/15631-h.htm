<p>The great event of the week has been the action of the Senate in passing
the Morgan Bill, recognizing the belligerency of Cuba.</p>

<p>Belligerency, as you doubtless remember, means being engaged in
legitimate warfare.</p>

<p>The resolution was passed by a vote of 41 to 14.</p>

<p>The Morgan Bill, which was a joint resolution of both houses, was also
brought up in the House of Representatives, but nothing was done with
it. Speaker Reed was careful that it should not be brought to a vote,
for it is understood that the President will not take any decided steps
in Cuban matters until Mr. Calhoun returns from Havana, and he is able
to learn the true state of affairs from him.</p>

<p>The Speaker and certain members of the House of Representatives will
therefore endeavor to keep the resolution from being voted on until the
President's views have been learned, so that there may be no such
trouble as there was with Mr. Cleveland last December over the Cuban
question. We told you about this on page 213 of the first volume of
<span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>.<!-- Page 870 --><a name="Page_870" id="Page_870"></a></p>

<p>The resolution, as passed by the Senate, reads:</p>

<p><i>"Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That a condition of public war
exists between the Government of Spain, and the Government proclaimed
and for some time maintained by force of arms by the people of Cuba, and
that the United States of America shall maintain a strict neutrality
between the contending powers, according to each all the rights of
belligerents in the ports and territory of the United States."</i></p>

<p>A great many people are sorry that the Senate has passed the resolution.
They insist that those who are in favor of helping Cuba are foolish
people, who do not realize that this resolution, if indorsed by the
House of Representatives, and approved by the President, will plunge the
country into war with Spain.</p>

<p>They declare that it is only an outburst of Jingoism, which should be
promptly crushed.</p>

<p><i>Jingoism</i> has become such a common word in politics to-day, that it may
amuse you to know just how it came into use, and what it means.</p>

<p>In 1877, during the Russo-Turkish war, there was a very strong party in
England which was in favor of helping the Turks against the Russians.
They urged the Government, which was under Lord Beaconsfield (the great
Disraeli), to go to the aid of the Turks, and make war on the Russians,
who were advancing on Turkey, and it was feared might take the city of
Constantinople.</p>

<p>The outcry for this legislation became so strong that men's minds were
full of it. Every paper had something to say on the subject, in every
pulpit and every <!-- Page 871 --><a name="Page_871" id="Page_871"></a>theatre allusions were made to the absorbing topic of
the hour, and it seemed as if war must be the outcome. In the midst of
this excitement a song appeared, the words of which ran:</p>

<div>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"We don't want to fight, but, by Jingo, if we do,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We've got the ships, we've got the men, we've got the money too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">We've fought the Bear before, and while we're Britons true,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The Russians shall not have Constantinople!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>This verse so exactly suited the feelings of the people that they went
wild over it. It was sung everywhere, until finally the mere whistling
of the air was enough to rouse a frenzy of patriotism and a thirst for
war.</p>

<p>One day, during a heated discussion in Parliament, a member alluded to a
previous speaker, who had declared himself in favor of supporting
Turkey, as "one of the 'by-Jingo-if-we-do' party."</p>

<p>From that moment the war party was christened the Jingo party, the men
who belonged to it were called Jingoes, and the platform of the party
was "<i>Jingoism</i>."</p>

<p>The Russo-Turkish war came to an end, but the word lived on, and now,
twenty years after, we find it in use in our own country, and applied to
our own politics. The word has in fact become a part of our language,
and is incorporated in our modern dictionaries.</p>

<p>The quieter people insist that there is a great deal of Jingoism in the
United States Senate to-day, and that the people who clamor for the
recognition of Cuba are Jingoes, who want war with Spain. Many people
think that the proper course for us to pursue is to let Spain settle her
own affairs her own way.<!-- Page 872 --><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872"></a></p>

<p>Every one is most anxious to know what the President intends to do about
Cuba.</p>

<p>It is asserted that he is not at all in favor of the Morgan resolution.
He wants to end the war, but he does not think that is the right way to
go about it. It is said that he will endeavor to bring about a peaceful
settlement of the matter by suggesting that the Cubans be given the
right of absolute self-government, in return for a sum of money which
they shall pay to Spain for her expenses of the war.</p>

<p>If these friendly offices are not accepted, it is said that the
President will intervene in a more determined way.</p>

<p>In the mean while the House of Representatives has also voted in favor
of the Relief Fund for the unhappy Americans in Cuba.</p>

<p>The proper means of distributing the Fund has been considered, and it
has been decided that supplies of food and clothing shall be purchased
here, and sent to Cuba. When the supplies reach Cuba their distribution
will be left in the hands of Consul-General Lee.</p>

<p>A complication has unfortunately arisen, which may delay the giving out
of the relief for a little while.</p>

<p>When it was found that there were some 1,200 American sufferers in Cuba
who needed immediate help, our Government approached the Spanish
Government to see if any objection would be made to the sending of
relief.</p>

<p>Spain, as we have already told you, gave us to understand that there
would be no objection whatever, and the State Department was pleased to
find that no obstacles would be put in the way of the good work.<!-- Page 873 --><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873"></a></p>

<p>When the manner of giving the relief was discussed in the Cabinet, it
was decided that as supplies were so scarce in Cuba, and the prices
asked for provisions so high, it would be better to purchase the
supplies in this country, load a ship with them, and send them over.</p>

<p>A difficulty immediately arose. Spain has placed certain Custom-House
duties on this class of goods. Our Government sent to the Spanish
representative, and asked that these duties be remitted, as the goods
were not being sent for sale, but for charity.</p>

<p>The Spanish officers said they were extremely sorry to be unable to
oblige us, but declared that they had not the power to remit the duties.</p>

<p>They said that such action could only be taken by the Spanish Cortes
(the Congress) or by a special decree of the Crown.</p>

<p>They said that owing to the annoyance felt by Spain over the passing of
the Morgan resolution, it would not be safe to ask the Cortes for any
such concession. Such a request would be likely to raise a storm about
Cuban affairs that might overthrow the Ministry, and encourage Carlist
uprisings.</p>

<p>The Spanish Minister declared that it would be just as dangerous to ask
for a Royal Decree. The enemies of the Government would rise against it,
and insist on a change of Ministry.</p>

<p>Whether this statement is true or false, it puts us in the very
unpleasant position of having to pay a large part of our Relief Fund to
the Spanish Customs, or to keep our poor countrymen waiting for the help
they so sorely need until the matter can be arranged.</p>

<p>The Spaniards say that when they offered to help <!-- Page 874 --><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874"></a>us in distributing the
Fund they had no idea but that the supplies would be purchased in Cuba.</p>

<p>While this tariff affair is annoying and distressing us, other
difficulties have been cleared out of the way of getting the supplies to
Cuba by the generous action of the owners of the Ward line of steamers.</p>

<p>One of the directors of this line called at the State Department in
Washington, and offered the Government the use of one of its steamers to
carry the food and provisions to the starving Americans in Cuba.</p>

<p>The offer was most gladly accepted, and the ship will carry food,
clothing, and medicine to the unhappy little island which was once so
proudly called "the Pearl of the Antilles."</p>

<p>The steamer will also be used to bring back to this country those
Americans who desire to leave Cuba.</p>

<p>It is said that the Spanish army is very much opposed to the idea of the
American Consuls giving out the relief.</p>

<p>The soldiers insist that the food and money should be turned over to the
Spanish authorities, who should have full charge of the distribution.</p>

<p>If the stories about dishonest officials in Cuba are true, it is to be
feared that very little of our $50,000 would find its way to our
countrymen if it were managed as the Spaniards wish.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The inquiry into the Ruiz case is going on.</p>

<p>The Spaniards have received Mr. Calhoun very politely, and have shown
him much attention.</p>

<p>While they do not appear to be putting any difficulties in the way of
his investigations, it is evident that <!-- Page 875 --><a name="Page_875" id="Page_875"></a>they do not intend to help him
find out anything about the matter.</p>

<p>When the inquiry began, the officials declared to Mr. Calhoun that they
did not know that Dr. Ruiz was an American. General Lee would not allow
such a statement as this to pass; he insisted that the Spaniards were
perfectly well aware of the fact, because he himself had informed them
of it.</p>

<p>The next stumbling-block was the disappearance of a Spanish witness who
could have proved that the officials knew all about the fact of Dr.
Ruiz's nationality. All the witnesses who do appear are in such fear of
the consequences of speaking the truth that Mr. Calhoun has great
difficulty in getting any information at all.</p>

<p>The news of the recognition of the belligerency of Cuba by the Senate
has been carefully kept from the people of Havana, and the Spanish
Government is eagerly waiting to see what the President will do.</p>

<p>The Morgan Resolution appears to have annoyed Spain very much, and the
Relief Fund is considered as an insult to Spain.</p>

<p>It is openly said that the Government ought not to allow it to be
distributed.</p>

<p>It has been feared that the Spanish in Cuba might attack the American
Consuls, and endeavor to prevent the supplies from reaching the right
people.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that they will not attempt anything so foolish as
that, for they will speedily learn that they have made a grave mistake.
President McKinley declares that he will protect the Americans who are
in Cuba, and if the Spaniards interfere, he <!-- Page 876 --><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876"></a>may feel it his duty to
show them, by force of arms, that the United States can and will protect
her citizens.</p>

<p>Mr. Calhoun expects to remain another ten days in Cuba, and on his
return we may hope for some solution of the difficulty.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The report that Russia has persuaded Turkey to grant an Armistice proved
to be true.</p>

<p>On the 18th of May the Czar of Russia sent a letter to the Sultan,
asking him in very polite and friendly terms to grant a cessation of
hostilities.</p>

<p>The Sultan replied in the same friendly manner, and said that on receipt
of the Czar's letter he had ordered the Turkish generals to stop
fighting. He said that he was very willing that the Powers should
arrange a settlement of his difficulty with Greece.</p>

<p>The next day an Armistice was signed, which bound all the land and sea
forces of both nations to keep the peace for seventeen days.</p>

<p>A commission was appointed to decide on a strip of land between the two
armies, which should be regarded as neutral ground, and across which
neither army should be allowed to advance during the continuance of the
armistice.</p>

<p>The Armistice has not found favor with the Turks; they are grumbling
very much at it. They do not want to withdraw from Greece until they
have reached Athens itself.</p>

<p>The most open of these grumblers are being sent back to Turkey under
escort, and the priests who are with the army have been ordered to teach
the soldiers <!-- Page 877 --><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877"></a>to be obedient, and to listen to the commands of the
Sultan.</p>

<p>In spite of the Armistice there is still some fighting going on. The
Greek Government has sent word to the Powers protesting against it, and
also against the way the Turks are destroying and robbing the villages
in Thessaly.</p>

<p>During the Armistice the Powers will do their best to arrange the terms
of peace, but, as we have already told you, the victorious Turk is going
to be a very difficult person to deal with, and the Powers find they now
have very little influence with him.</p>

<p>It is said that the Sultan is not willing to have the Powers interfere
at all, and has sent word to the Greeks that his general, Edhem Pasha,
can arrange the terms of peace with them.</p>

<p>The Greeks, however, replied that they had put the case in the hands of
the Powers, and therefore could not treat with Edhem Pasha.</p>

<p>The Powers are annoyed that Turkey should try to put them aside, but
this is probably but a foretaste of what the Sultan will do, now that he
feels himself of importance in Europe.</p>

<p>There was for a time some difficulty in getting all the Powers to agree
about the terms for peace, but word reaches us that Germany has at last
given her approval to the note of the Powers, and that it has been
despatched to the Sultan.</p>

<p>The exact wording of the note has not been made public, but it is said
that its tone is very mild and friendly.</p>

<p>The note is said to object to the Turkish demand for Thessaly, and while
it agrees that Greece should pay <!-- Page 878 --><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878"></a>some money to Turkey for the expenses
of the war, it declares that the sum asked for is much too large.</p>

<p>It is impossible to guess what the Sultan's answer will be, and in truth
he appears to be in a very unpleasant position himself in regard to the
matter.</p>

<p>The victories of their army have so excited the Turkish people that they
are murmuring against the dictation of the Powers, and declare that the
Government showed weakness in granting an Armistice before the Greeks
had agreed to give up Thessaly and pay the sum demanded.</p>

<p>So threatening have the people become, that the Sultan has doubled the
patrols in Constantinople, and is taking great precautions to guard his
own palace.</p>

<p>He gives as his reason for doing so that the Armenian National Festival
is about to occur, and he is afraid of an outbreak that would cause
fresh Armenian troubles.</p>

<p>The Turks have, however, set their hearts on regaining Thessaly, and the
Sultan will have hard work to appease them if he agrees to the terms of
the Powers. If he refuses, the Powers may declare war upon him.</p>

<p>It also seems likely that there may be trouble over Thessaly with the
religious element. The Sultan has been informed by one of the old
Sheiks, or Chiefs, that it is the will of Allah (the Moslem word for
God) that Thessaly shall be reunited to Turkey.</p>

<p>If he listens to this, the followers of Mohammed may rise, and,
unfurling the banner of the prophet, sweep over Thessaly, and take it
from the hands of the Greeks, putting every one who opposes them to the

<p>The Fur Seal question is being very actively discussed on all sides, and
many interesting facts have been brought to light in connection with it.</p>

<p>Mr. David Starr Jordan, the President of the Leland Stanford University,
wrote a very fine article on the subject which appeared in <i>The Forum</i>
last month.</p>

<p>He said that the shameful practice of killing the mother seals when they
went to their feeding-grounds could be entirely stopped by a means much
simpler than the making of a treaty with Great Britain. This means, he
stated, has already been tried and found to be most satisfactory; it was
in short, branding the skins of the female puppies.</p>

<p>To brand means to mark with a hot iron.</p>

<p>Branding is a practice in use among all cattle raisers, who are thus
able to mark their beasts, and if they stray, can recognize and recover
them.</p>

<p>In the West, when the owners round up their cattle to count and separate
them, each man can tell his own stock by the brand. At the round-up, the
young calves, which have been born since the last count, are also
marked.</p>

<p>The branding of the seals is not for purposes of identification, but so
to destroy the skin of the female seal that it will have no market
value.</p>

<p>The seal puppies can be easily caught and handled. Last year three
hundred and fifty of them were marked <!-- Page 880 --><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880"></a>with a series of bars across the
back, which had much the appearance of a huge face.</p>

<p>The hair will never grow again over the spot that has been burned, and
the marks are made in all the best parts of the fur, so that the skin is
utterly destroyed, and the seal is no longer worth killing.</p>

<p>The pups that had been branded were very carefully watched until they
had quite recovered from their burns, and it was found that none of them
had been injured by the branding, nor did their altered appearance seem
to make any difference in their habits, nor in the friendliness of their
tribe toward them.</p>

<p>The Dingley Tariff Bill was brought up in the Senate last week.</p>

<p>It promises to be a very long while before a vote is reached on this
subject.</p>

<p>Senator Aldrich, who has charge of the bill in the Senate, explained its
various portions with the greatest care.</p>

<p>He stated that it was the desire of the framers of the bill to assist
the growth of agriculture, commerce, and manufacture, and that their one
aim was to enable American industries to compete with those of foreign
countries.</p>

<p>He went on to say that there was no desire to raise the rate of taxation
on imports (or goods brought into this country) to such a height that
people could no longer afford to deal in them, the idea was merely to
fix the price at such a figure that foreign goods could not be sold for
less money than native goods could be manufactured for.</p>

<p>The friends of the measure, Mr. Aldrich said, hoped <!-- Page 881 --><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881"></a>in this way to
encourage American industries, and increase the prosperity of the
country.</p>

<p>There is much agitation in Europe over the Dingley Bill.</p>

<p>In the Italian Chamber of Deputies, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said
the Government was watching the outcome of the Tariff Bill with the
greatest interest.</p>

<p>He stated that the Government had called the attention of the United
States to the injuries that Italian trade would suffer if the bill were
passed.</p>

<p>He went on to say that while Italy did not intend to raise her tariff on
American goods in return, she would undoubtedly levy heavy taxes on
Americans doing business in Italy if the bill were passed.</p>

<p>The attitude of Germany is even more threatening than that of Italy.</p>

<p>The German Ambassador sent an official letter to Mr. Sherman, the
Secretary of State, the other day, saying that the proposed duty on
sugar is considered a violation of the commercial treaty between Germany
and the United States.</p>

<p>He requested the Secretary of State to call the attention of Congress to
the matter, and inform them that they will break the agreement with
Germany if they pass this clause of the bill.</p>

<p>He added a little hint of the course his country will take in case the
bill becomes law.</p>

<p>He said that in 1891 an arrangement had been made between Germany and
the United States for the importation of German sugar to this country
and the exportation of American pork to Germany.</p>

<p>He said in the plainest terms that if the Dingley Bill <!-- Page 882 --><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882"></a>is passed in its
present form, the German Government will break the agreement in regard
to pork and other agricultural products from this country, and levy such
a heavy tax on them that it will not pay us to export them, so that this
trade with Germany will be ruined.</p>

<p>Mr. Havemeyer is now on trial in Washington for not answering the
Senate's questions in 1894. It is said that if he is found guilty he may
be sent to prison for a whole year, instead of merely for one month, as
Mr. Chapman was.</p>

<p>It would seem as if the Trusts were not going to have it all their own
way any longer. The Coal Trust is now to be looked into.</p>

<p>A referee has been appointed to take testimony about the so-called Coal
Trust, to see if such a combination really exists. If it is found that
there is indeed a Coal Trust, the Attorney-General will take proceedings
against it, and, if possible, break it up.</p>

<p>The Coal Barons are of course fighting this action fiercely.</p>

<p>They declare that the new law, under which their business methods are to
be looked into, is not in accordance with the Constitution of the
country, and that they will not submit to it until the State has proved
that the law is constitutional.</p>

<p>This new law, which was made after the Lexow investigations, only came
into existence on the 7th of May, 1897. It provides that the price or
the supply of an article shall not be controlled by any one, and that an
attempt to assume such control is unlawful and shall be punished.<!-- Page 883 --><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883"></a></p>

<p>It also adds that the Attorney-General may order witnesses to come
before a judge, and may ask them any questions he chooses about their
business methods, and that he may also examine the books and accounts of
their business whenever he has a mind to.</p>

<p>Finally, the law states very clearly that witnesses must answer all the
questions put to them, and that if they refuse to answer they shall be
punished for contempt of court.</p>

<p>The Coal Barons say they are quite willing to answer any questions,
because they have been carrying on their business in a perfectly proper
way. They are, however, most unwilling to have the Attorney-General go
over their books. They insist that the personal liberty of a citizen is
interfered with if this law is carried out, and so they are determined
to fight it.</p>

<p>The modern method of mining coal is very interesting, and especially so
when we understand that from the mine to the cellar the coal is handled
almost exclusively by machinery.</p>

<p>The miners go down the shaft and blast off the coal. They shovel what
has been loosened by the blast into wagons, which hold about two and a
half tons.</p>

<p>These wagons are hoisted on the elevator to the mouth of the mine, and
from the moment the coal sees the daylight, the work in connection with
it is done by machinery.</p>

<p>The wagons dump their loads into a chute which sends the coal sliding
down into the breaker. This machine breaks up the large lumps in which
it is brought out of the mine, and divides the coal into the various
sizes, nut, stove, egg, etc.<!-- Page 884 --><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884"></a></p>

<p>From the breaker the coal is carried to the washer, and then back to the
breaker ready to be sold.</p>

<p>As soon as the coal is ready to be loaded a train of trucks is brought
up in front of the breaker, a lever is touched, and the coal comes
pouring down into the trucks. A whole train can be loaded in ten minutes
by this process.</p>

<p>From the breaker the cars carry the coal to the canal-boats that are
waiting for it. The cars run on a trestle, and discharge their loads
through chutes into the boats, without a shovel having touched it since
the miners first blasted it out of the earth and loaded it on the
wagons.</p>

<p>Professor Winchell, in his "Sketches of Creation," gives a very
interesting description of a coal mine. He says:</p>

<p>"Armed each with a miner's lamp, and clad in a miner's garb borrowed for
the occasion, we step upon a platform, or "cage," six feet square,
suspended by iron rods connected with machinery moved by an engine, and,
at the word, begin to sink into the darkness beneath us. This
perpendicular hole, perhaps eight feet square, is called the shaft.</p>

<p>"Continuing to descend, we perceive the bed of coal underlaid by clay,
with abundant grass-like shoots and occasional stems of vegetation.</p>

<p>"We hang before the portal to a long avenue excavated in a deeper-seated
bed of coal. In some of the dark and dusty chambers which open here the
miner's pick is heard, and now and then the muffled report of the
miner's blast comes echoing through the vaulted aisles.</p>

<p>"But this is not the station where we are intended <!-- Page 885 --><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885"></a>to stop. Our car
moves on, and we plunge through two hundred feet more of the rocky rind
of the earth. Above us the mouth of the shaft seems narrowed into an
insignificant hole; before us opens a dark street, over which, on a
tramway, mules are hauling carloads of coal, which is starting on its
way to the surface. Miners with picks are moving to and fro; the sound
of hammers is heard, the signs of busy life are about us.</p>

<p>"In the seam of coal, passages are cut about eight feet wide and about
five feet high. These are shored up with timber or iron, to prevent them
giving way.</p>

<p>"A main gangway may be half a mile or a mile in length. From this, at
suitable intervals, passages are quarried out, running at right angles
with the main gangway.</p>

<p>"These chambers cross and recross one another, and make a network of
passages like the streets of a city.</p>

<p>"Along the principal passages tram-rails are laid to carry the coal to
the shaft. The trams are moved over the track by mules, which often
spend their lives underground. They are stalled and fed in side rooms
cut out of the coal.</p>

<p>"By the feeble light of the miner's lamp we enter one of these aisles.
The whole thickness of the coal seam is exposed along the walls.</p>

<p>"Here and there a white shell projects, showing us that the products of
the sea are suspended over our heads.</p>

<p>"Then a very different sight will greet our eyes. The rocky ceiling will
be ornamented everywhere with the most delicate tracery, faultless
representations of the delicate fronds of ferns.</p>

<p>"We remove a scale from the rock, and behind is <!-- Page 886 --><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886"></a>still another picture.
The whole mass of the shaly roof is a portfolio of inimitable sketches.
The sharpest outlines and the minutest serratures are clearly traced.
Buds, woody stems, cones, fruits, grasses, rushes, club mosses, all are
by turns pictured on the dusky ceiling."</p>

<p>In another portion of his book, Professor Winchell speaks of very
curious things that have been found in many instances by miners in the
heart of a coal mine.</p>

<p>These are the trunks of trees, which are found standing upright as
though still growing.</p>

<p>Mr. Winchell says:</p>

<p>"These tree-trunks are from one to five feet in diameter, and are
sometimes sixty or seventy feet in height.</p>

<p>"In many instances they have been found standing erect, and have
evidently been buried by accumulations of mud and sand.</p>

<p>"In the excavation of a bed of coal these petrified trees are not
unfrequently cut off below, when the slight taper of the trunk permits
them to slide down into the mine.</p>

<p>"These 'coal pipes' are much dreaded by English miners, for almost every
year they are the cause of fatal accidents."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The tailors of New York are striking for better wages and shorter hours.
They want laws to protect them, for they complain that their wages are
often left unpaid.</p>

<p>Several of the Unions in neighboring cities have joined the New Yorkers,
and it is expected that the strike will be a long one.<!-- Page 887 --><a name="Page_887" id="Page_887"></a></p>

<p>This strike is peculiar in one sense, for, while the workmen are really
fighting the contractors, these same contractors are heartily in
sympathy with them, and hope that they will win.</p>

<p>The contractors are the people who make the garments for the large
wholesale houses, and they declare that the low prices the wholesale
houses pay for the clothes is the cause of all the trouble.</p>

<p>Formerly the contractor was able to get $1.25 for making a coat, now the
manufacturers will only pay 75 cents.</p>

<p>As the manufacturers' prices went down, the contractors had less money
to pay their hands with, and they were obliged in turn to reduce the
wages of the workers.</p>

<p>When the wages were as low as the contractors dared make them, they
increased the day's task, and forced the workers to make more coats in
their day's work.</p>

<p>For the first time in six years all the branches of the tailors' trade
have joined in the strike.</p>

<p>The leaders from all the various organizations have had meetings, and
consulted as to the scale of wages to be demanded from the contractors,
and the terms on which the strikers will return to work.</p>

<p>It is hoped that they will be able to hold out until the end of June,
when the busy season for making winter clothes begins, and when the
wholesale houses will be obliged to consent to pay higher prices for the
garments or lose their winter business.</p>

<p>A great deal of sympathy is felt for the strikers. The President of the
Police Board actually went to one of their meetings and addressed them.<!-- Page 888 --><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888"></a></p>

<p>He told them that he believed their cause was a proper one, but warned
them that they would ruin themselves if they used any violence.</p>

<p>He said that he had been told that some of their number had begun to get
restless and grumble, so he had dropped in on them in a friendly way, to
ask them to be careful, and not do anything to bring them in contact
with the police.</p>

<p>So far there has been no rioting or violence.</p>

<p>The contractors have offered to take the men back and pay them the wages
they ask, on the "piece" system, which means that they will give a
certain sum for each garment they make.</p>

<p>The leaders of the strike will not consent to this. They think that
paying by the piece will make it possible for the sweating system to
come into use again, and this they say is a much worse evil than the one
they are now trying to cure.</p>

<p>A surprising discovery was made at West Point the other day.</p>

<p>The quartermaster suddenly discovered that four of the cannon captured
in the Mexican war by General Scott's army had been stolen.</p>

<p>These guns had been lying for years in Fort Clinton, which is an
earthwork overlooking the Hudson River, and only about four hundred feet
from the row of brick houses occupied by the officers of the post.</p>

<p>One of these guns was particularly valued by the War Department, as it
had been captured at Monterey.</p>

<p>The cannon had been in the fort for many years, and as it was never
supposed that they would be stolen, there had been no special guard
placed over them.<!-- Page 889 --><a name="Page_889" id="Page_889"></a></p>

<p>No one had the slightest idea how the guns had been stolen. Every
attempt was made to discover the thieves, and at last Colonel Ernst, who
is the commander of the post, obtained a clue which may lead to the
discovery of the miscreants.</p>

<p>It seems that a carter, who has been going back and forth to West Point
for a very long time, carrying packages and supplies, is the suspected
person.</p>

<p>He has lately taken to lingering around the post until after dark.</p>

<p>The sentries have stated that on several occasions it was quite late
when he drove past them.</p>

<p>He always gave a good excuse for his delay, and being a well-known
character at the Point, he was allowed to pass.</p>

<p>Colonel Ernst thinks that the cannon have been carried off one by one by
this man, and sold to some junk-dealer as old metal.</p>

<p>It is supposed that he must have had some accomplices to help him lift
the cannon into his cart, and that he carefully steadied them so that
they would not rumble and betray him, covered them up with tarpaulin,
and drove out with them, under the very nose of the sentry, returning to
fetch another at the next favorable opportunity.</p>

<p>Word has been sent to every junk-dealer, in hopes of finding the
Monterey cannon before it has been put into the melting-pot.</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM OUR YOUNG FRIENDS.</h2>


<div class="blockquot"><span class='smcap'>Dear Editor</span>:

<p>     Is it asking too much of you, or is it out of your line of work to
give your readers some information in regard to the old library at
Tel-el-Amarna; and something about the present reigning family of
Egypt, as to its origin and its political relations to the European
powers?</p><br />

<p>     If you have not room for a note on these, where could I obtain best
account of them? </p></div>

<br /><br /></div>


<div><span class='smcap'>Dear Madam:</span></div>

<p>Tel-el-Amarna is the ruin of a residence of Amenophis IV. in Central
Egypt. In the winter of 1887-88 there were discovered there about three
hundred clay tablets, covered with cuneiform inscriptions which have
since been deciphered.</p>

<p>They contain the diplomatic correspondence of Kings of Babylon, Assyria,
Palestine, and other countries of Western Asia with the Egyptian court.</p>

<p>The word library applies not only to books, but is often used to
indicate a collection of inscribed tiles or bricks.</p>

<p>2. Mehemed Ali was made Viceroy of Egypt and Pasha of Three Tails in
1806.</p>

<p>He resigned in favor of his son Ibrahim Pasha in 1849.</p>

<p>Ibrahim died the same year, and was succeeded by Mehemed Ali's favorite
grandson, Abbas Pasha, who died in 1854, and was succeeded by his
brother Said.</p>

<p>In 1863 Said died, and was succeeded by his nephew Ismael, who promoted
the Suez Canal.<!-- Page 891 --><a name="Page_891" id="Page_891"></a></p>

<p>In 1866 the Sultan of Turkey, who is the nominal ruler of Egypt, made
this family hereditary Viceroys of Egypt.</p>

<p>In 1879 Ismael abdicated in favor of his son Mohammed Tewfik, who died
in 1892 and was succeeded by his son Abbas.</p>

<p>Under this family, Egypt, though nominally tributary to Turkey, has
enjoyed all the advantages of an independent kingdom.</p>

<div><span class='smcap'>Dear H.T.</span>:</div>

<p>Our country promises to take care of all her citizens, and so we have
not the slightest doubt young Mayer will be properly looked after.</p>

<p>As soon as our Ambassador in Germany has given the German Government
satisfactory proof that young Mayer was born in this country, there is
very little doubt that he will be excused from serving in the German
army.</p>

<p>You are a very good little boy to be so full of sympathy for Cuba, but
you must not wish any harm to Spain&mdash;for that is <i>not</i> good of you. You
must remember that there are always two sides to every question. If we
could look at the Cuban war from Spain's point of view, we should
perhaps think that the Cubans were a rebellious, tiresome people who had
cost Spain much money; and the lives of many brave men. We might perhaps
think that they deserved punishment, and that General Weyler was only
trying to do the best he could for his country, and was not punishing
the Cubans more than they deserved.</p>

<p>I say, we might think this if we were Spaniards, and the war was taking
our dear friends away from us and making us poor besides.<!-- Page 894 --><a name="Page_894" id="Page_894"></a></p>

<p>As we are neither Cubans nor Spaniards we are able to look calmly at the
whole affair, and judge it without any personal feeling creeping in to
prejudice us. We have decided that Cuba ought to be free, and that hers
is the righteous cause, but for all that we must not wish harm to Spain.</p>

<p>Spain believes she is in the right, or else she would not be willing to
make the terrible sacrifices she is making.</p>

<p>As long as she believes she is right we should not call her hard names
and wish her ill. We ought instead to pray that the good God may show
her the right way, and give her the courage to walk in it.</p>

car with one wheel that they call a bicycle train runs. Yours

<div><span class='smcap'>Dear Charles:</span></div>

<p>The seal question has puzzled many wiser heads than ours; and no one has
arrived at a proper solution of it yet.</p>

<p>We tell you in our paper this week of a new plan that has been suggested
to prevent the mothers and puppies from being killed.</p>

<p>Seals are found in nearly all waters, but the seal whose fur is so
valuable to us is found only in the North and South Pacific oceans, and
not in the Atlantic.<!-- Page 895 --><a name="Page_895" id="Page_895"></a></p>

<p>Seals are found in the Mediterranean Sea, the Caspian Sea, along the
European shores of the Atlantic; off the coast of Greenland, and off the
Atlantic coast of the United States, but these seals have not the under
fur we described to you in <span class='smcap'>The Great Round World</span>, and are of
little market value compared with the Pacific Ocean seals.</p>

<p>We do not understand your question about the bicycle car. Explain it
more fully, and we will do our best to answer it.</p>

<p>     I am very much interested about Spain and Cuba and the Philippine
Islands, and about the elephants that live in India. I have lately
taken your paper, which comes every week. I have read the first
paper over and I like it very much. </p></div>

<p>     I am very much interested in your little paper. It has a great deal
in it for such a little paper. I give it to my teacher. I do not
write many letters so far away as you are, as I live on the other
side of the Great Lakes. I like most of all to hear about the wars,
and hope that Cuba and Greece will win.</p>

<p>     I think I had better close now. </p></div>

<p>Do not think that you must not write to us because you are far away. For
that very reason there must be numbers of things going on around you
which would be strange to us, and which we would much <!-- Page 896 --><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896"></a>like to hear
about. Write often, and let the kind post-office show you that you are
not so very far away, after all.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
